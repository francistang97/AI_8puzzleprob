# AI_8puzzleprob
8-puzzle searching problems solving algorithm


•	The task is to write a program that will solve the 8-puzzle problem using three different search algorithms, and their variants.

•	The successors of a state are to be generated in a FIXED order, to be drawn from left to right, namely move the blank tile: Up, Right, Down, then Left.

There are six different search algorithms will be used in this project:

Part 1: Breadth-First Search
a.	Without the Visited List
b.	Using the Visited List

Part 2: Progressive Deepening Search
a)	Without the Visited List
b)	Using the Non-Strict Visited List

Part 3: A* Search using the Strict Expanded List
Use the following heuristics:
a)	Number of Misplaced Tiles (aStar_ExpList_MisplacedTiles)
b)	Manhattan Distance (aStar_ExpList_Manhattan)
